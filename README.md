Development
----
### Setup local

- Please run this command to install required dependencies
  ```
  yarn
  ```
- Create an `.env` in your project folder (beside `.env.example`) with your [Google API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (with Maps JS, Geocoder permissions)
  ```
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=<api-key>
  ```
### Start development

This command will start a quasar development server, which will also watch your file changes to live-reload
```
yarn start
```

You can preview your changes at http://localhost:8080

### Folder structure

Here is basic structure of source folder, which I regrouped some components from quasar's default boilerplate for ease of maintenance in a modular way:

```
src
 |- assets  // App assets
 |- config
     |- router    // Routes & router config
     |- store     // Store config
     |- index.ts  // Some other static config
 |- hubs    // Components for hub list & map
 |- lib     // Libraries
     |- errors    // Error pages
     |- layouts
     |- ...
 |- services      // Error pages
 |- ...
```
### Customize configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

Deployment
----
### Build production

For a production-ready build of the application, please use this command:
```
yarn build
```

### Deploy to firebase 

There is a Github Actions pipeline defined in `.github` folder for manually one-click deployment to Firebase Hosting
